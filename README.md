# Multiclass-classification
A multiclass classifier where the response variable (column256) can be one of the five possible classes A, B, C, D, E. The dataset doesn't include the names of the variables because it's not a public one.  Machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, random forests and MLP are used where for the two last we find the optimal parameters using GridSearch().
